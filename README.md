# Yash's Shell

This is a basic, lightweight implementation of a UNIX shell.

To compile and run:

```bash
>> make clean
>> make
>> ./bin/yashShell
```

In addition to typical shell commands, features include:

`>> history` : Prints the previous HIST_LEN number of commands

`>> exit` : Exits the terminal

`>> time` : Prints the current date and time in an human readable form

`>> cd` : Changes the directory
